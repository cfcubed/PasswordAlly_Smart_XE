# PasswordPump II
Version 2 of the PasswordPump, for the ItsyBitsy M4.

The PasswordPump II is a USB device that helps you manage and enter your credentials for computers, applications and web sites.  The purpose of this repository on GitHub is to disseminate software for and information about the PasswordPump II.  See the Password Pump II Users Guide.pdf for details.  PasswordPumpM4_02.dip is a DIPTrace (https://diptrace.com/) file.  You can use DIPTrace with that file to create the files necessary to manufacture the custom PCB.
