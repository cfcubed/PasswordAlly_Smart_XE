  
Note that the board in the DIPTrace PCB design is actually an ATMega32U4, not an ItsyBitsy M4, so the pad names are wrong.
This does not affect the design of the PCB.

I’m using DIPTrace to do the PCB design.  It’s freely available at https://diptrace.com/.  Download the DIPTrace file and open it with DIPTrace to edit the PCB design.  This is really the first PCB I’ve ever designed, so if you have suggestions please feel free to let me know.  I’ve also included the design files you’ll need if you want to order the custom PCB on your own.
