This version of the PCB hasn't yet been tested.  The most important change is that U1:7 and U2:7 are now connected to 3V3 on the ItsyBitsy.
I have tested connecting U1:7 and U2:7 to 3V3 by soldering a wire between them, so I'm confident the change is correct.

Note also that the board in the DIPTrace PCB design is actually an ATMega32U4, not an ItsyBitsy M4, so the pad names are wrong.
This does not affect the design of the PCB as the footprints are the same.
