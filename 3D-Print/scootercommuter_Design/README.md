Here's a redesigned case made by scootercommuter in OpenSCAD.  All dimensions are calculated in OpenSCAD from the assembled board dimensions (by his caliper measurements). 

* The cover can be put on, and removed, without removing the knob (easier on the rotary encoder).
* It has rounded corners, which I personally prefer.
* The USB cable hole is made to fit the USB cable supplied by the PasswordPump Store.  The top is slotted for the cable also.  Probably most cables will fit.
* The fit of the knob hole is dependent on the positioning of the rotary encoder when it is soldered in.  So, he left a lot of slack with the hole size.
* Only 3 screws can be used due to the positioning of the RGB LED.
* It needs to be printed with supports enabled, because of the countersink holes and the oval USB hole.

It is designed for M2 x 8mm screws and hex nuts.  He had button hex head screws, but pan head will work just fine.  Scootercommuter had an issue with the "Hilitchi" brand screws he bought -- the "8mm" long screws are actually just 7.85mm long, so they barely were able to engage the hex nuts.  During his struggles with this, he opted for hexagonal countersink holes for obvious reasons.
